# Clever-Encounter-Builder
Self-contained encounter builder for DnD
Hey there! This is my solution for keeping track of monster hp and stats. 

The use is pretty straight forward, and it's got the steps as you go through it. But basically, you're building an old school website for your encounter.

This is how I build my images, all the stats I need, and I don't have to deal with WOtC sending me a cease and desist for copyright stuff.
Just grab a screen shot of the monsters you want and toss them all into the same folder, upload them into the CEB, then manually enter in how many of each you want and their hp.
The CEB will spit out an HTML formatted file that is intended to live in the folder with all your images. There's also a handy hp function I built to save me from writing 400 numbers everytime I run a combat.
